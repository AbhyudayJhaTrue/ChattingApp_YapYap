# YapYap

YapYap is a lightweight, privacy-focused Python-based chatting app. Designed with safety in mind, YapYap is **not connected to any server or online account system**. This means your identity and data remain private and secure—there are no random user accounts to be found online, making it an ideal solution for chatting safely and avoiding unwanted interactions.

## Features

- **Local-Only Chatting**: YapYap does not connect to any remote server. All interactions are local, ensuring your conversations remain private.
- **No Online Accounts**: To avoid risks like online predators, there is no global account database. If you want to chat with someone, you’ll need to find and add their account information in real life.
- **Simple Interface**: The app is easy to use and designed for quick, secure interactions.
- **Future Sign Up Feature**: A sign-up feature is planned for future versions—but even then, accounts will not be discoverable online.

## Why YapYap?

- 🛡️ **Privacy First:** No central server means conversations are not tracked or stored anywhere except your own device.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Safety:** Users cannot be searched or contacted by strangers online.
- 🚫 **No Pedos, No Creeps:** YapYap’s offline-first design helps prevent unwanted or dangerous connections.

## Planned Features

- **Sign Up System:** Coming soon. This will allow users to create local accounts, but these will not be registered or searchable online.
